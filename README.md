# Girls Frontline Resource Calculator
A Calculator to check how long it would take to obtain a user-inputed value for a desired amount of resources.
The calculator will also tell you how many resources you could produce in an hour using logistic support missions.

# Usage
To use the program, just enter in your data in the appropriate fields and click the calculate button.

## Resources
To determine how long it will take to generate a certain amount of resources, input how much you currently have
in the first group box, then how much you want in the second. The numericUpDowns are labeled for each resource.

## Logistics
To check resources per hour, just select which chapter and episode the echelon will participate in, then click calculate.
You can have up to 4 echleons in logistics at once; normally each echelon cannot select the same episode as another
but **the program won't stop you from doing this.** You can also check the great reward checkBox, and it will tell you how much resources you could generate if it was a great success (% chance based on echelon).
